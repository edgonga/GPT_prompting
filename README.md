# GPT_prompting
A test how to use OpenAI API generating chat GPT responses (with Python)


To start the project, you will have to run the following commands: 

```py
pip install openai
```
```py
pip install python-dotenv
```
```py
pip install os
```

And, the following command could be necesary if the library is not updated:

```py
pip install --upgrade requests urllib3
```

As GPT API is not free, everytime that we make a call is not going to work.
Fortunately, OpenAI has released some tutorials on how to use that API (with code to test), see the below link:
